Study Abroad Destination Analysis Project

Welcome to my **Study Abroad Destination Analysis** project! This tool was designed to assist myself in comparing key data points across various international destinations. By leveraging the power of **Excel**, this project provides actionable insights for making informed decisions.

## Overview

The project involves a comprehensive dataset that compares study abroad destinations based on:
- **Tuition fees**
- **Living expenses**
- **Ease of Travel**
- **Quality of education**
- **Weather and City Size**

Using Excel's features, such as:
- **Vlookups**: Charts, graphs, and heatmaps to make data easier to interpret.
- **Bar Charts**: Filter data to focus on specific regions, costs, or academic priorities.
- **Conditional formatting**: Highlight key trends.

## Purpose

This project was created to:
- Provide clear, data-driven insights for evaluating study abroad destinations.
- Help users identify destinations that align with their budget and academic goals.
- Enhance decision-making for individuals and institutions involved in study abroad planning.
